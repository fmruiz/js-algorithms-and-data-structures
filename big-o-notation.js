/**
 * BIG O NOTATION:
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 * 1) - It allows us to talk formally about how the runtime of an algorithm
 * Grows as the input grow
 *
 * 2) - Using for measure the performance and complexity of the algorithms
 *
 * 3) - Using to describe how much time or resources consume one specific fn
 *
 * 4) - It is very important because the goal of the Big O Notation is to identify
 * And compare between algorithms to discover who is more efficient
 * If we talk about resources and execution time
